# your_team_name

Hello! This is a template repository in which you can upload your deliverables for the CHORAS ASSA Workshop. The deliverables are

1. 🎧 Impulse response from DE (.wav)

2. 📊 T30 results from DE in (.csv)

3. 5️⃣ Frequencies of first 5 modes from DG in (.csv)

4. (Optional) 📊 T30 results from DG (up to the 250Hz band) in (.csv) as calculated with pyfar

5. 📃 This readme filled with the correct information :)

_Feel free to remove this section when you're done :)_
